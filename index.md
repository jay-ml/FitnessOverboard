## Project Description
*Avast ye landlubbers, grab your mateys and see if you have what it takes to walk, run, and skip your ship to victory.  Fitness Overboard will keep single and multi-person crews engaged in weekly fitness challenges, letting you prevent scurvy while pushing your friends into the briny deep!*

As of 2018, 42.4% of adults in the United States were considered obese (Hales et al. 2020).   Broken down by age, 40% of those ages 20-39 are considered obese and 44.8% of adults aged 40-59 years old were in this category.  Obesity is directly correlated to an increased risk of numerous health concerns including: strokes, high blood pressure, various types of cancer, and severe complications from COVID-19.  To address this issue, we are proposing the Fitness Overboard system to encourage more households to get active together.   Each week, Fitness Overboard households will receive a set of weekly challenges.  They can choose to compete against one another or opt to join community challenges which rank them against other households they are friends with.  This system provides a mechanism of accountability for families and individuals.  During the week, they will get motivational messages based on their progress on the goals.  At the end of each week, the system will populate individual and household awards.  In the community setting, you can use your awards to launch virtual cannonballs at the enemy ship of your choosing.
